Title : Build a CNN model for image classification

Description: In this dataset, there are roughly 3,700 images of flowers. Five subdirectories, one for each class, are present in the dataset: 
 daisy/
 dandelion/
 roses/
 sunflowers/
 tulips/

Tasks: a) Split the dataset for training and testing
       b) build the   CNN model for different parameters
       c) use keras optimiser function to get the best parameters for your model
       d) after fitting the data we use the test data to predict our accuracy of our model

Results: We build a CNN model which can predict with 90% confidence of which class of flowers does a particular photo belong to
